# Rust Repository

Welcome to the Rust Repository! This repository is designed to help you learn the basics of Rust programming language. Each directory in this repository focuses on a specific topic and contains examples and explanations to help you understand the key concepts.

## Directory Structure

- `hello-rust`: Introduction to Rust with a simple "Hello, World!" program.
- `Variables`: Understanding variables and mutability in Rust.
- `Data Types`: Exploring different data types in Rust, including scalar and compound types.
- `Input`: Handling user input in Rust.
- `Functions`: Defining and using functions in Rust.
- `Ownership`: Understanding Rust's ownership model and how it ensures memory safety.
- `Modules`: Organizing code using modules in Rust.
- `Structs`: Defining and using structs to create custom data types.
- `Enums`: Defining and using enums to represent different states or variants.
- `Error Handling`: Handling errors in Rust using `Result` and `Option` types.
- `Generics and Traits`: Using generics and traits to write flexible and reusable code.
- `Vectors`: Working with vectors, a growable array type in Rust.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your system.
- Familiarity with basic programming concepts.

### Running the Examples

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-basics.git
   cd rust-basics
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory of the topic you want to explore:
   ```sh
   cd hello-rust
   ```

3. Compile and run the example code:
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

## Topics Overview

### 1. Hello, Rust
Learn how to set up a Rust project and write a simple "Hello, World!" program.

### 2. Variables
Understand how to declare variables, use mutability, and shadowing in Rust.

### 3. Data Types
Explore Rust's scalar types (integer, floating-point, boolean, and character) and compound types (tuples and arrays).

### 4. Input
Learn how to read user input from the console using the `std::io` module.

### 5. Functions
Understand how to define functions, pass arguments, and return values in Rust.

### 6. Ownership
Dive into Rust's ownership system, including concepts of borrowing and lifetimes.

### 7. Modules
Learn how to organize your Rust code into modules for better code management and readability.

### 8. Structs
Define and use structs to create custom data types with named fields.

### 9. Enums
Use enums to define types that can be one of several variants.

### 10. Error Handling
Handle errors gracefully in Rust using `Result` and `Option` types.

### 11. Generics and Traits
Write generic functions and data types, and understand how to use traits for code abstraction.

### 12. Vectors
Work with vectors, Rust's growable array type, including adding, removing, and accessing elements.
