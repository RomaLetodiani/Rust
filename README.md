- [Variables](/2.%20variables/): Understanding variables and mutability in Rust.
- [Data Types](/3.%20data-types/): Exploring different data types in Rust, including scalar and compound types.
- [Input](/4.%20input/): Handling user input in Rust.
- [Functions](/5.%20functions/): Defining and using functions in Rust.
- [Ownership](/6.%20ownership/): Understanding Rust's ownership model and how it ensures memory safety.
- [Modules](/7.%20modules/): Organizing code using modules in Rust.
- [Structs](/8.%20structs/): Defining and using structs to create custom data types.
- [Enums](9.%20enums/): Defining and using enums to represent different states or variants.
- [Error Handling](/10.%20error-handling/): Handling errors in Rust using `Result` and `Option` types.
- [Generics and Traits](/11.%20generics_and_traits/): Using generics and traits to write flexible and reusable code.
- [Vectors](/12.%20vectors/): Working with vectors, a growable array type in Rust.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your system.
- Familiarity with basic programming concepts.

### Running the Examples

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/RomaLetodiani/Rust.git
   cd rust
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory of the topic you want to explore:

   ```sh
   cd hello-rust
   ```

3. Compile and run the example code:
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

## Topics Overview

### 1. [Hello Rust](/1.%20hello-rust/)

Learn how to set up a Rust project and write a simple "Hello, World!" program.

### 2. [Variables](/2.%20variables/)

Understand how to declare variables, use mutability, and shadowing in Rust.

### 3. [Data Types](/3.%20data-types/)

Explore Rust's scalar types (integer, floating-point, boolean, and character) and compound types (tuples and arrays).

### 4. [Input](/4.%20input/)

Learn how to read user input from the console using the `std::io` module.

### 5. [Functions](/5.%20functions/)

Understand how to define functions, pass arguments, and return values in Rust.

### 6. [Ownership](/6.%20ownership/)

Dive into Rust's ownership system, including concepts of borrowing and lifetimes.

### 7. [Modules](/7.%20modules/)

Learn how to organize your Rust code into modules for better code management and readability.

### 8. [Structs](/8.%20structs/)

Define and use structs to create custom data types with named fields.

### 9. [Enums](9.%20enums/)

Use enums to define types that can be one of several variants.

### 10. [Error Handling](/10.%20error-handling/)

Handle errors gracefully in Rust using `Result` and `Option` types.

### 11. [Generics and Traits](/11.%20generics_and_traits/)

Write generic functions and data types, and understand how to use traits for code abstraction.

### 12. [Vectors](/12.%20vectors/)

Work with vectors, Rust's growable array type, including adding, removing, and accessing elements.
